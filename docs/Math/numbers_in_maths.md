Mathematics encompasses a wide variety of numbers, each with unique properties and uses. Here’s a comprehensive guide to the different types of numbers:

## 1. Natural Numbers

- **Definition**: The set of positive integers used for counting.
- **Examples**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...
- **Notation**: ℕ

## 2. Whole Numbers

- **Definition**: Similar to natural numbers but including zero.
- **Examples**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
- **Notation**: ℕ₀ or W

## 3. Integers

- **Definition**: All positive and negative whole numbers, including zero.
- **Examples**: ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
- **Notation**: ℤ

## 4. Rational Numbers

- **Definition**: Numbers that can be expressed as the quotient of two integers, where the denominator is not zero.
- **Examples**: 1/2, -3/4, 5, 0.75
- **Notation**: ℚ

## 5. Irrational Numbers

- **Definition**: Numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction. Their decimal expansion is non-repeating and non-terminating.
- **Examples**: √2, π (pi), e (Euler's number)
- **Notation**: Not typically denoted by a specific symbol but known through examples.

## 6. Real Numbers

- **Definition**: All numbers on the number line, including both rational and irrational numbers.
- **Examples**: -1, 0, 1/2, √3, π
- **Notation**: ℝ

## 7. Imaginary Numbers

- **Definition**: Numbers that, when squared, give a negative result. They are used to extend the real number system.
- **Examples**: i (where i² = -1), 3i, -2i
- **Notation**: Often represented with the imaginary unit i.

## 8. Complex Numbers

- **Definition**: Numbers that consist of a real part and an imaginary part.
- **Examples**: 2 + 3i, -1 - 4i
- **Notation**: ℂ

## 9. Prime Numbers

- **Definition**: Natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.
- **Examples**: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11
- **Notation**: Not typically denoted by a specific symbol but known through examples.

## 10. Composite Numbers

- **Definition**: Natural numbers greater than 1 that are not prime, meaning they have divisors other than 1 and themselves.
- **Examples**: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10
- **Notation**: Not typically denoted by a specific symbol but known through examples.

## 11. Perfect Numbers

- **Definition**: Positive integers that are equal to the sum of their proper divisors (excluding themselves).
- **Examples**: 6 (1 + 2 + 3), 28 (1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14)
- **Notation**: Not typically denoted by a specific symbol but known through examples.

## 12. Transcendental Numbers

- **Definition**: A subset of irrational numbers that are not roots of any non-zero polynomial equation with integer coefficients.
- **Examples**: π (pi), e (Euler's number)
- **Notation**: Not typically denoted by a specific symbol but known through examples.

## Conclusion

Understanding these various types of numbers is fundamental to grasping different areas of mathematics. Each type of number has its own properties and plays a unique role in mathematical theories and applications.
